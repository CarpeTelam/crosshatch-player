# Display lab: the panel scan bench (spike, Part A)

The display lab is a bench, not a product mode. It lives in `src/activities/games/display_lab/` and
`lib/GameDisplayLab/`, compiles only under `FREEINK_CAP_DISPLAY_LAB`, which the `x4pro` development env alone sets, so
no release build (`x4pro-gh_release*`) ever carries it (the simulator's HAL stand-in has no `HalDisplay::eink()`, so the
row is absent there too), and shows its row only on an X4 Pro whose panel probe found a controller with a scan
backend (SSD1677 so far) or an UltraChip controller (UC8179, UC8279) without one, which gets the
[UltraChip stock-path bench](#ultrachip-stock-path-bench) instead of the scan screens. The row's subtitle says which:
"Panel waveform bench" for the scan screens, "UltraChip stock-path bench" for the stock bench.
It answers the two numbers only a panel can give before Part B (the per-pixel grayscale engine, deferred in
`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/deferred-work.md`) can be built:

1. the **frame period**: how long one frame of a one-frame activation takes, from the slope of BUSY time against
   TP[0A];
2. the **drive polarity** of the two LUT rows a pixel can select: which of LUT1 (the BW-plane row) and LUT2 (the
   RED-plane row) darkens the panel under the codes the lab tries first (VSL on row 1, VSH1 on row 2, InkBoy's SSD1681
   convention).

Safety: every LUT the lab sends carries the panel's stock voltages (bytes 105-109 = `0x17 0x41 0xA8 0x32 0x30`), the
OTP command is never sent, each scan goes through the SDK facade's overlay-grayscale path with `factoryMode=true`
(the upload of the 105 LUT bytes plus the voltage registers, command 0x22 = 0xCC, a timed BUSY wait), a scan whose
call took over 15,000 ms ends its run and the panel is cleaned (a wait cannot be interrupted, and the SDK's own BUSY cap
is 30 s, so a hung panel can stall the lab up to 30 s per scan), 2,400 scans since the last clean force a FULL refresh,
and leaving the lab by any route (Back, Home, sleep) runs one FULL refresh when a scan reached the panel since the last
clean, and frees the backend's two PSRAM planes and the lab's two PSRAM masks.

## Hardware checklist (the user's validation script)

1. Build and flash: `flock /tmp/crosshatch-build.lock sh -c 'pio run -e x4pro -t upload'`; open a serial monitor at
   the env's baud with `LOG_LEVEL` 1 or more (the `x4pro` development env prints `DLAB` lines at `LOG_INF`).
2. If the display is inverted (Settings), turn that off first: the facade drops grayscale calls while inverted, and the
   lab shows "Turn off the inverted display first" instead of its menu.
3. Home → Games. On an SSD1677 X4 Pro the last row is **Display lab** with the subtitle "Panel waveform bench"; on a
   UC8179 or UC8279 unit it reads "UltraChip stock-path bench" and opens the stock bench's menu instead (Transition
   timing, Gray ramp, Exit; follow [its own steps](#ultrachip-stock-path-bench) after the warning). Either subtitle is
   itself a check of the gate (`DisplayLabActivity::available()`, `usesStockBench`).
4. Confirm the entry warning. Back or Cancel there returns to the launcher and sends nothing to the panel.
5. **Frame period**: select it, then Run. The lab shows "Running" and performs nine all-hold scans (no pixel is
   driven, so the screen stays): TP[0A] in {1, 10, 100} against the frame-rate bytes {0x22, 0x11, 0x44}, tp outer.
   Copy the nine lines from the log, for example:

   ```
   [DLAB] tp=1 fr=0x22 busy_us=...
   [DLAB] tp=1 fr=0x11 busy_us=...
   [DLAB] tp=1 fr=0x44 busy_us=...
   [DLAB] tp=10 fr=0x22 busy_us=...
   ...
   [DLAB] tp=100 fr=0x44 busy_us=...
   ```

   The screen lists the same nine busy times. A line reading `timeout` (and a "Timed out" row) means a scan ran over
   15 s: the run stopped there and the panel was cleaned; report it with the lines before it. A "Dropped" row means the
   facade refused the call (see Expected ranges).
6. **Polarity**: select it, then Row 1, labelled "Row 1 (LUT1 VSL)" on an SSD1677 (the backend names each row). The
   whole panel is driven with VSL for 10 frames and the screen is *not*
   repainted: look at the panel and note whether it went darker or lighter all over (the change is uniform and may be
   subtle, since 10 frames is a short drive). Only Confirm or a tap brings the screen back, with a FULL refresh; Up and
   Down move the selection but do not repaint while the drive is shown. After that repaint the next activation runs
   the row it lands on: select Row 2 and do the same with VSH1. Two log lines name each row and its time:

   ```
   [DLAB] polarity row=1 vs=LUT1 VSL ms=...
   [DLAB] polarity row=2 vs=LUT2 VSH1 ms=...
   ```

7. Photograph the panel after each polarity drive (before pressing a key) and the frame-period table.
8. Leave with Back. The log's `exit: N scans this session` line and one FULL refresh end the session.

## Expected ranges

- Busy time grows with TP for a fixed frame-rate byte; the frame period is `(busy(100) - busy(1)) / 99` microseconds
  per frame. SSD1677-class panels at their usual frame rates give a period in the low tens of milliseconds per frame
  (roughly 10-25 ms), so expect `tp=100` scans of about 1-2.5 s and `tp=1` scans dominated by the fixed overhead of the
  LUT upload (105 bytes to 0x32 plus the voltage registers) and activation (tens of milliseconds). If the three frame-rate bytes give the same slope, the
  byte's encoding does not reach this activation; if they differ, the ratio between them is the data Part B needs.
- Exactly one of the two polarity rows darkens the panel. If Row 1 (VSL) lightens and Row 2 (VSH1) darkens, InkBoy's
  convention holds on this panel: white = VSL on the BW-plane row, black = VSH1 on the RED-plane row. If it is the other
  way round, Part B swaps the codes (`GameDisplayLab::POLARITY_ROW1/2`).
- A "Dropped" status (log line `dropped: scan N came back in M us, under the 500 us floor`) means the facade refused the
  call and the panel was not driven, usually because the display is inverted (the control-center panel can invert it
  while the lab is open; the lab also refuses outright, logged as `scan refused: display inverted`, when it sees the
  inversion first). Turn inversion off and run again; a dropped time is not a measurement.

## UltraChip stock-path bench

On the UC8179 and UC8279 batches no facade call reaches the waveform registers yet (the SDK lab seam is the epic's
option 1), so the one-frame scan bench cannot run there. The stock-path bench (story dlab-u1) measures what the public
facade already offers on those panels, with `HalDisplay` calls only: no custom LUT, no register write, no `eink()`. The
gate (`usesStockBench`, `StockBenchGate.h`): an UltraChip controller with no scan backend; a controller with a scan
backend always gets the scan screens. The lab opens no scan session for it (no backend, no masks), and keeps the entry
warning, the inverted refusal (on entry and again per run), the 15,000 ms timeout per timed step (the reference, the arm's base and gray pass, each flip, the ramp's base and
gray pass; a step over it ends the run before the next panel call), and one FULL refresh on
every way out of a screen that drove the panel (Back promotes it onto the menu's repaint; Home and sleep run it in the
screen's `onExit`).

**Transition timing** times the stock non-flashing previous-to-current transition, the facade call behind a grayscale
page's base: `displayGrayscaleBase(FAST_REFRESH)`. The bench calls `HalDisplay` with `turnOffScreen=false`; the reader
goes through `GfxRenderer`, which passes the sunlight fading fix as `turnOffScreen`, so with that setting on the
reader's transition also pays a power-off that these timings leave out. Run, blocking:

1. A checker of 4 x 2 blocks into the framebuffer, then one plain `displayBuffer(FAST_REFRESH)`, timed: the reference
   (`DLAB transition ref ms=`). It runs first because after a gray pass the drivers turn a plain FAST into the
   transition (`_redriveAfterGray`).
2. Arming. Per the drivers (`Uc8179Driver.cpp`, `Uc8279X4Driver.cpp`), `displayGrayscaleBase(FAST)` takes the
   transition only when a gray pass has run since the controller was last initialized (`_grayRefreshedOnce`; begin,
   wake and the UC8179 direct-gray setup clear it), the previous plane is valid, and no full clear is pending;
   otherwise it falls back to `display(FAST)`, a FAST DU when the previous plane is valid and no clear is pending, a
   flashing full GC otherwise. An ordinary refresh never arms it. So the run arms it with one overlay gray pass of
   all-B/W masks (both planes zero) over the same checker: `displayGrayscaleBase(FAST)` timed as the base, then
   `copyGrayscaleBuffers` + `displayGrayBuffer` timed as the gray pass, each checked against the timeout, then
   `cleanupGrayscaleBuffers` (untimed); one line logs their sum (`DLAB arm ms=`). A panel that reports no overlay
   grayscale (UC8279 variant 0x67) skips it (`DLAB arm skipped: no overlay grayscale`). The arm's base is a plain FAST
   on the first run after boot or wake, but the transition itself on later runs and after a Gray ramp pass or a reader
   AA page (a gray pass has already run), so `arm ms` is not comparable across those cases.
3. Ten flips: the checker, inverted on odd flips, through `displayGrayscaleBase(FAST_REFRESH)`, each timed
   (`DLAB transition n=<i> ms=<ms> flashed=<yes/no>`).

The table shows the reference, the arm, each flip (marked "fell back" when flagged), and the flips' min, median and
max (a flip over the timeout is left out of them); it is redrawn with a FULL refresh after every run. **The
fell-back heuristic** (`transitionFellBack`): `flashed=yes` means the flip fell back to a plain refresh instead of the
transition (the story's definition), not that the eye saw a flash. Unarmed, every flip is a plain refresh, so every
flip is flagged, though a FAST DU (the fallback when the old plane is valid) does not visibly flash; armed, every fallback the drivers can still take is a full GC
(a pending clear or no valid old plane), much slower than a FAST, so a flip taking 2 x the reference or more is
flagged. The factor 2 (`FELL_BACK_FACTOR`) is a guess, not a measurement: the table shows raw milliseconds so the owner
can judge, and the photo or eye tells a flash apart.

**Gray ramp** paints the OEM four-level grayscale: four bands, black, dark gray, light gray, white, left to right as the
device is held, through the overlay masks (`freeink-sdk/docs/grayscale-capabilities.md`: (LSB, MSB) dark (1, 1), light
(0, 1), B/W (0, 0); the base is black under the three darker bands). Activation: `displayGrayscaleBase(FAST_REFRESH)`
timed as the base, `copyGrayscaleBuffers` + `displayGrayBuffer` timed as the gray pass (what a caller pays for it),
then `cleanupGrayscaleBuffers` (untimed); logged as `DLAB gray base_ms=<> gray_ms=<>`. As with the arm, the first
activation's base after boot or wake is a plain FAST and later ones (or any after a Transition run or a reader AA page)
take the transition, so `base_ms` is not comparable across those cases. The panel keeps the ramp until the next
Confirm or tap, which only repaints the screen with a FULL refresh. A panel without overlay grayscale shows "This panel
reports no overlay grayscale" and logs `DLAB gray unsupported`; no pass is sent. On a UC8279, a gray pass whose MSB
plane covers over 25 % of the panel (this ramp's two gray bands cover half) runs the driver's four-tone quality bank.

Hardware steps (after the checklist's steps 1-4, on a UC8179 or UC8279 unit; the log shows
`DLAB UltraChip stock-path bench` on entry):

1. **Transition timing** → Run. The panel shows the checker, a gray pass over it, then ten flips. Copy the lines:

   ```
   [DLAB] transition ref ms=...
   [DLAB] arm ms=...
   [DLAB] transition n=1 ms=... flashed=no
   ...
   [DLAB] transition n=10 ms=... flashed=no
   ```

   and photograph the table. Note by eye whether any flip flashed (black-white-black). An armed flip flagged
   `flashed=yes` is the heuristic's guess at a full-GC fallback, which does flash; on an unarmed run every flip is
   flagged and none need flash, so there the flag says nothing about what the eye sees.
2. **Gray ramp** → activate the row. Photograph the four bands before pressing a key, and copy
   `[DLAB] gray base_ms=... gray_ms=...`. The next Confirm or tap brings the screen back with a FULL refresh.
3. Leave with Back: one FULL refresh.

Nothing here is calibrated yet: an armed flip that took the transition should not flash and should log
`flashed=no`; a flagged flip is the heuristic's guess at a fall-back, so report it with its time and what the eye saw.
A `timeout: ...` line means a timed step ran over 15 s: the run stopped and the next repaint is a FULL refresh.

## Where Part B picks up

Part B (deferred-work.md, "Display lab Part B") takes the measured frame period as the length of one dose and the
polarity answer as the row-to-color mapping, and builds on the scan seam (the display-lab epic's D1): a `ScanRequest`
of two full-screen drive masks (`GameDisplayLab::MaskPlanes`: black, white, a pixel in neither holds), a frame count, a
rate index and a polarity swap, sent through `DisplayLabActivity::scan`, which wraps the controller's `ScanBackend`
with the session cap, the timeout and the dropped-call floor. A new controller is one backend class plus its case in
the one switch of `ScanBackends.cpp`, and the screens and the safety rules stay as they are: the backend names its
own drive rows (`ScanBackend::rowLabel`, the epic's Amendment D1a; on the SSD1677 "LUT1 VSL" and "LUT2 VSH1"), which
the polarity screen shows and logs as `vs=`, and the frame-period screen runs the backend's own rate list. The
frame-period TPs and the polarity TP are frame counts every backend takes. On top of it come the
per-pixel level and dose model, the transition-test screen with sweeping rectangles, the live tuning list, and the SD
preset. Nothing in Part A is a product feature; the launcher row and the lab can be removed once Part B has its own
entry.

## Code map

- `lib/GameDisplayLab/Ssd1677ScanLut.{h,cpp}`: the 112-byte scan LUT builder (105 LUT bytes, five voltage bytes, two
  reserved) and the experiment tables; pure C++, pinned byte for byte by `test/game_display_lab/test_scan_lut.cpp`.
  Its `planeFillFor` and `framePeriodScan` are no longer used by the screens: they are Part A's reference, which
  `test_ssd1677_encoding.cpp` pins the seam against.
- `lib/GameDisplayLab/LabExperiments.h`: the experiments' request layout, controller-neutral: `FRAME_PERIOD_TPS`,
  `POLARITY_TP`, the frame-period scan order (`framePeriodTp`, `framePeriodRate`: tp outer, rate inner) and the
  polarity row to mask table (`POLARITY_ROW_MASKS`: row 1 white, row 2 black); pinned against Part A by
  `test_ssd1677_encoding.cpp`.
- `lib/GameDisplayLab/Ssd1677Encoding.{h,cpp}`: the SSD1677 backend's pure parts: its rate list (the three frame-rate
  bytes, in order), the LUT for one request (`buildOneFrameLut` with the rate's byte and the row codes, swapped on
  request), the row labels (`ssd1677RowLabel`), and the planes from the masks (white to BW, black to RED); pinned
  against Part A's bytes by
  `test/game_display_lab/test_ssd1677_encoding.cpp`.
- `lib/GameDisplayLab/MaskPlanes.{h,cpp}`: the two drive masks in the framebuffer's byte order (MSB first, row-major,
  100 bytes per row at 800 px): clear, fill, clipped rectangles and pixels; pinned by
  `test/game_display_lab/test_mask_planes.cpp`.
- `lib/GameDisplayLab/ScanBudget.h`: the session cap, the timeout, and the dropped-call floor, pinned by
  `test/game_display_lab/test_scan_budget.cpp`.
- `src/activities/games/display_lab/ScanBackend.h`: the gate macro, `ScanRequest`, and the abstract `ScanBackend`
  (the epic's D1).
- `src/activities/games/display_lab/ScanBackends.{h,cpp}`: `hasScanBackend` and `makeScanBackend`, one case per
  controller; only SSD1677 has a backend so far.
- `src/activities/games/display_lab/Ssd1677ScanBackend.{h,cpp}`: the SSD1677 facade calls (its two PSRAM planes,
  `copyGrayscaleBuffers`, the timed `displayGrayBuffer(false, lut, true)`) and the cleaning FULL refresh.
- `src/activities/games/display_lab/DisplayLabActivity.{h,cpp}`: the menu, the gate, the session (the backend and the
  two PSRAM masks), the controller-neutral `scan()` wrapper (the inversion and rate checks, the session cap, the
  timeout rule), and the exit refresh.
- `src/activities/games/display_lab/FramePeriodActivity.{h,cpp}` and `PolarityActivity.{h,cpp}`: the two experiments.
- `lib/GameDisplayLab/StockBench.{h,cpp}`: the stock-path bench's pure parts: the checker frame (`fillChecker`), the
  gray ramp in the overlay encoding (`rampShadeAt`, `fillGrayRamp`), the timing summary (`summarizeTimings`) and the
  fell-back heuristic (`transitionFellBack`); pinned by `test/game_display_lab/test_stock_bench.cpp`.
- `src/activities/games/display_lab/StockBenchGate.{h,cpp}`: `usesStockBench` (an UltraChip without a scan backend)
  and the launcher row's subtitle (`labRowSubtitle`).
- `src/activities/games/display_lab/TransitionTimingActivity.{h,cpp}` and `GrayRampActivity.{h,cpp}`: the stock
  bench's two screens; the lab menu (`DisplayLabActivity`, `buildStockRows`, `activateStock`) opens them in place of
  the scan screens.
- `lib/hal/HalDisplay.h`: the one upstream touch, `EInkDisplay& eink()` under `FREEINK_CAP_GAMES` (ledger row 13).
